# wpTribu Theme

This is the theme used on wpTribu.org. It's an [o2](https://geto2.com) ready theme based on the [wporg](https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/browser/sites/trunk/wordpress.org/public_html/wp-content/themes/pub/wporg) theme.

+ It fixes o2's behavior when it's used from a blog page (and not from the site's home).
+ It uses its own way of dealing with mentions (instead of relying on JetPack ones).
+ It restricts o2's perimeter to the blog page, post categories, post tags and post authors only.
+ It is optimized for the [Handbook](https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/browser/sites/trunk/wordpress.org/public_html/wp-content/plugins/handbook) plugin integration.
